            Paulo Coelho's enchanting novel has inspired a devoted following around the world. This story, dazzling in
            its powerful simplicity and soul-stirring wisdom, is about an Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago, who
            travels from his homeland in Spain to the Egyptian desert in search of a treasure buried near the Pyramids.

        Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, the son of a little-educated boat-owner in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, had an
        unparalleled career as a defence scientist, culminating in the highest civilian award of India, the Bharat
        Ratna. As chief of the country's defence research and development programme, Kalam demonstrated the great
        potential for dynamism and innovation that existed in seemingly moribund research establishments. This is the
        story of Kalam's rise from obscurity and his personal and professional struggles.

            1900 BC. In what modern Indians mistakenly call the Indus Valley Civilisation. The inhabitants of that
            period called it the land of Meluha a near perfect empire created many centuries earlier by Lord Ram, one of
            the greatest monarchs that ever lived. This once proud empire and its Suryavanshi rulers face severe perils
            as its primary river, the revered Saraswati, is slowly drying to extinction. They also face devastating
            terrorist attacks from the east, the land of the Chandravanshis. To make matters worse, the Chandravanshis
            appear to have allied with the Nagas, an ostracised and sinister race of deformed humans with astonishing
            martial skills!
