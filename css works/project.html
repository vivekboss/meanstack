        Everything Gets Better With Coffee.
    </div>

    <div class="write">
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The first branded coffee to be sold commercially to the public was Nescafé in 1879. The drink is
        made from the seeds
        of the coffee plant, called coffee beans. Coffee is usually served hot, and is a popular drink in many
        countries.
        Coffee contains a chemical called caffeine, a mild drug that keeps people awake.Cold coffee is also a popular
        milk
        based drink. In many recipes, especially desserts, such as Tiramisu and some Ice Creams, coffee is used as a
        popular
        flavouring agent.Coffee can help people feel less tired and increase energy levels ( 1 , 2). Coffee is a
        language
        itself!!!

                <h3>Latte</h3>
            </u>
            <p>A latte begins with the same base — a single or double shot of espresso. This espresso is then combined
                with several ounces of steamed milk to create a rich, creamy beverage that has a more subtle espresso
                taste. ... The latte is then topped with a layer of foam.</p>

            <p>Outside of Italy, cappuccino is a coffee drink that today is typically composed of a single espresso shot
                and hot milk, with the surface topped with foamed milk. ... The top third of the drink consists of milk
                foam; this foam can be decorated with artistic drawings made with the same milk, called latte art.</p>

                Black coffee is rich in antioxidants, which can fight cell damage and reduce your risk of serious health
                conditions like cancer and heart disease. Coffee is the primary source of antioxidants in most American
                diets.

            </u>
            <p>Like a caffè latte, caffè mocha is based on espresso and hot milk but with added chocolate flavouring and
                sweetener, typically in the form of cocoa powder and sugar. Many varieties use chocolate syrup instead,
                and some may contain dark or milk chocolate.Caffè mocha, in its most basic formulation, can also be
                referred to as hot chocolate with (e.g., a shot of) espresso added.</p>

            <u><h3>Americano</h3></u>
            <p>It is essentially an espresso shot diluted with water. There are two different ways to prepare this drink
                that can alter its look. First: hot water first, then espresso on top and second: espresso first, then
                diluting with hot water after.</p>
